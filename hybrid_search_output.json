Here are a couple of other online sports betting sites that are thriving in other states, one or both of which could potentially come to Vermont eventually.\\r \\r\\nCaesars Vermont promo code\\r \\r\\nCaesars Sportsbook has become one of the most popular online sportsbooks in the US in several states, and it should prove a favorite in Vermont as well. We expect Caesars to offer the same offer in VT is has elsewhere, with new sign-ups eligible to receive up to a $1,000 Bonus Bet if their first bet loses.\\r \\r\\nCaesars covers wide range of markets and different bet types while also featuring a terrific live betting platform. The site offers frequent odds boosts and other bonuses, and new sign-ups also get to join the famed Caesars Rewards program that can earn them more site bonuses among other benefits.\", \"file_id\": \"66a12956-ef15-44e1-94f8-35a7b5f9b6bc\", \"chunk_index\": 17, \"file_name\": \"Vermont_Sportsbook_Promos_and_Sports_Betting_Launch_News.txt\"}, {\"content\": \"There are multiple welcome offers and not just a single offer\\r \\r\\nYou don’t have to risk a lot — just $5 — to receive a total of $200 in Bonus BetsYou also don’t have to worry about winning or losing your first wager to get a bonus as with other sites’ offers\\r \\r\\nCons\\r \\r\\nThe 20% deposit match bonus worth up to $1,000 might sound good, but with a 25x wagering requirement it is truthfully only useful to high-stakes bettors\\r \\r\\nYou only get a week to use the $150 in Bonus Bets awarded for making your first wager of at least $5\\r \\r\\nYou only receive winnings and not the bet amounts when you use Bonus Bets\\r \\r\\nWhat will the welcome offer at DraftKings Sportsbook VT be?\\r \\r\\nWhen DraftKings Sportsbook Vermont launches, the site will feature the same multi-part welcome offer it has in other states: a $50 Bonus Bet just for depositing $5, another $150 in Bonus Bets for making a $5 wager, and a 20% deposit match bonus worth up to $1,000 in Bonus Bets.\\r \\r\\nWhat can I win with the DraftKings Sportsbook welcome offer?\\r \\r\\nDepending on how much in Bonus Bets you gather, you can win whatever you earn by placing successful wagers with them.\", \"file_id\": \"66a12956-ef15-44e1-94f8-35a7b5f9b6bc\", \"chunk_index\": 10, \"file_name\": \"Vermont_Sportsbook_Promos_and_Sports_Betting_Launch_News.txt\"}, {\"content\": \"Depending on how much in Bonus Bets you gather, you can win whatever you earn by placing successful wagers with them.What makes the DraftKings Sportsbook welcome offer better than others?\\r \\r\\nDraftKings Sportsbook outdoes other sites with multiple offers rather than just one. Also, the $200 total in Bonus Bets you can receive just for depositing and wagering $5 is the best deal around, and you don’t even have to win or lose your first bet. The deposit match bonus offer is unique as well, although not all new users will likely try to take advantage of it.\\r \\r\\nBetMGM Vermont promo code\\r \\r\\nKnown as the “King of Sportsbooks,” BetMGM Sportbook is another favorite around the US and will surely be one should it launch in Vermont. BetMGM has applied for an online sports betting license and should be one of the new sites in VT. When that happens, Vermont bettors should be able to take advantage of BetMGM’s nice welcome offer of up to $1,500 paid back in Bonus Bets should they lose their first wager on the site.\", \"file_id\": \"66a12956-ef15-44e1-94f8-35a7b5f9b6bc\", \"chunk_index\": 11, \"file_name\": \"Vermont_Sportsbook_Promos_and_Sports_Betting_Launch_News.txt\"}]"

    "query": "Which online betting platform provides a welcome bonus of up to $1000 in bonus bets for new customers' first losses, runs NBA betting promotions, and is anticipated to extend the same sign-up offer to new users in Vermont, as reported by both CBSSports.com and Sporting News?",
    "answer": "AgentRunResult(data='Based on the search results, the online betting platform that matches your criteria is **BetMGM Sportsbook**. Here\\'s why:\\n\\n1. **Welcome Bonus**: BetMGM offers a welcome bonus of up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses. While this exceeds the $1,000 threshold you mentioned, it aligns with the general requirement of a substantial welcome bonus for new customers [citation:3a0287a6-1f98-40f6-8f29-f6259151f52e:4].\\n\\n2. **NBA Betting Promotions**: BetMGM is highlighted for its NBA betting promotions, such as \"bet $10, get $200,\" and its comprehensive odds markets for NBA games. The platform also provides live streaming of NBA games, enhancing the betting experience [citation:3a0287a6-1f98-40f6-8f29-f6259151f52e:4].\\n\\n3. **Vermont Expansion**: Although the search results do not explicitly confirm BetMGM\\'s extension of the sign-up offer to Vermont, they indicate that BetMGM has applied for an online sports betting license in Vermont. It is anticipated that the platform will offer the same welcome bonus to new users in Vermont as it does in other states [citation:66a12956-ef15-44e1-94f8-35a7b5f9b6bc:11].\\n\\nAdditionally, **Caesars Sportsbook** is another platform mentioned in the context of Vermont, offering a similar welcome bonus of up to $1,000 in bonus bets for new customers if their first bet loses. However, BetMGM\\'s prominence in NBA betting and its higher welcome bonus make it the more likely candidate matching your query [citation:66a12956-ef15-44e1-94f8-35a7b5f9b6bc:17].\\n\\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest reports from CBSSports.com and Sporting News or visiting the official BetMGM website.')",
